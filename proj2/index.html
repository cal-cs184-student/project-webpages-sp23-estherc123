		Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision
	</head>
	<h1 style="font-size:150%;">de Casteljau's algorithm and its implementation</h1>
	<body>

In simplicity, de Casteljau’s algorithm computes the bezier curve by recursively taking input control points and linearly interpolating between adjacent control points with respect to parameter t, which contains a value of 0 to 1, to generate sub-control points. Finally, return the value of that point when the number of control points reaches 1.
In our implementation we have done exactly that by iterating through adjacent vertices, points[i] and points[i + 1] and linearly interpolating by calling helper function lerp2 on parameter t. Then add the evaluated control point of the subcurve between, i.e the result of linear interpolation, to the list of sub-curves control points. Return the list of sub-curves control points to complete a step in the algorithm. Return the point if the number of control points is 1.
Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

		Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau
	</head>
	<h1 style="font-size:150%;">Extending de Casteljau algorithm to Bezier surfaces and its implementation</h1>
	<body>


The de Casteljau algorithm now handles points in 3-dimensions instead of 2-dimensions and this is done by calculating the slice of the surface, which is a curve, on two axes that points (u,v) lie. Given 3-D control points that has a row and a column and interpolation parameters (u,v), the bezier surface is calculated by iterating through all the rows of the control points and for each row the 1-D bezier (solved in part 1) parameterized by u, calculate the point on the 1-D bezier curve for each call. Then, calculate the point on the bezier curve parameterized by v on the list of all evaluated points from earlier. The point on the bezier curve is calculated in a modified algorithm based on part 1 except it is in 3D and that evaluateStep recurses until there is only one point.

		Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals
	</head>
	<h1 style="font-size:150%;">implementation of the area-weighted vertex normals</h1>


To implement an area-weighted vertex normal, it is necessary to keep track of total sum of vertex normal, iterate through the vertex’s (v_0) neighboring vertices, and calculate the area of faces incident to v_0 and the perpendicular vector formed by two adjacent vectors sharing the given vertex. This is done by calculating the matrix cross product of the two adjacent vectors from v_0 to get the normal vector of that face, and the norm of the cross product to get the area of the face. In each iteration, update the sum of vertex normal by adding the product of the area of the face and the norm. Lastly, update the sum of the vertex normal as a unit vector and multiply by -1 so that the direction of normal is not facing inside the mesh.

		Part 4: Edge flip
	</head>
	<h1 style="font-size:150%;">implementation of the edge flip operation</h1>


The implementation technique of edge flip is based on the “guide to implementing edge operations”. We first layout explicit definitions of all the half-edges, vertices, edges, and faces before the flip and this can be done by laying out the half edge of the given edge and traversing to get all half-edges including the outer edges using half-edge operations next() and twin(). Note that the outer edges are defined by the twin of the edges of the inside faces. Also note that assigning the vertices, edges, and faces to a corresponding half-edge pointer is not unique. Next, to flip the edge we have to reassign existing half-edges, vertices, edges, and faces’ pointers to match the new layout as shown in the before and after diagram above.

The major issue we have faced was whenever we tried to flip an edge, an edge and an outer face was missing. We have speculated that our implementation was incorrect on the outer edges and it turned out that our explicit definition of the outer half-edges formed a quadrilateral rather than outer_edge = outer_edge->next(). Further, when reassigning the outer half-edges, we have to preserve the face and their pointer to the next half-edge.

		Part 5: Edge split
	</head>
	<h1 style="font-size:150%;">implementation of the edge split operation</h1>	


The implementation technique of edge split is based on the “guide to implementing edge operations”. We first layout explicit definitions of all the half-edges, vertices, edges, and faces before the split and this can be done by laying out the half edge of the given edge and traversing to get all half-edges including the outer edges using half-edge operations next() and twin(). Note that the outer edges are defined by the twin of the edges of the inside faces. Also note that assigning the vertices, edges, and faces to a corresponding half-edge pointer is not unique. Unlike edge flip, an edge split creates 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, 2 new faces, and 6 new half-edges. Then reassign existing half-edges, vertices, edges, and faces’ pointers to match the new layout as shown in the before and after diagram above and ensure that the faces and next pointer of the half-edges of the outer elements are preserved.
