	<h1 style="font-size:150%;">Overview</h1>
	On a high level, we have implemented various operations on processing curves and surfaces: essentially, given points, either in 2D space or 3D space, we could model objects by either computing a continuous smooth curve/surface determined by these points, which is what we did in Section 1, or we could build a mesh with edges connecting these points, and this would look more "discrete". The interesting thing I found in this project is the symmetric nature of the mesh and halfedge data structure, making traversing through complicated shapes incredibly straight-forward to implement.
	
	<h1 style="font-size:150%;">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h1>	
	<h1 style="font-size:100%;">de Casteljau's algorithm and its implementation</h1>
	

In simplicity, de Casteljau's algorithm computes the bezier curve by recursively taking input control points and linearly interpolating between adjacent control points with respect to parameter t, which contains a value of 0 to 1, to generate sub-control points. Finally, return the value of that point when the number of control points reaches 1.
In our implementation we have done exactly that by iterating through adjacent vertices, points[i] and points[i + 1] and linearly interpolating by calling helper function lerp2 on parameter t. Then add the evaluated control point of the subcurve between, i.e the result of linear interpolation, to the list of sub-curves control points. Return the list of sub-curves control points to complete a step in the algorithm. Return the point if the number of control points is 1.
<br>
	Below are screenshots of each step / level of the evaluation from the original 6 control points down to the final evaluated point. <br>

	<h1 style="font-size:100%;">Extending de Casteljau algorithm to Bezier surfaces and its implementation</h1>
	


The de Casteljau algorithm now handles points in 3-dimensions instead of 2-dimensions and this is done by calculating the slice of the surface, which is a curve, on two axes that points (u,v) lie. Given 3-D control points that has a row and a column and interpolation parameters (u,v), the bezier surface is calculated by iterating through all the rows of the control points and for each row the 1-D bezier (solved in part 1) parameterized by u, calculate the point on the 1-D bezier curve for each call. Then, calculate the point on the bezier curve parameterized by v on the list of all evaluated points from earlier. The point on the bezier curve is calculated in a modified algorithm based on part 1 except it is in 3D and that evaluateStep recurses until there is only one point.<br>

	<h1 style="font-size:150%;">Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h1>
	<h1 style="font-size:100%;">implementation of the area-weighted vertex normals</h1>


To implement an area-weighted vertex normal, it is necessary to keep track of total sum of vertex normal, iterate through the vertex’s (v_0) neighboring vertices, and calculate the area of faces incident to v_0 and the perpendicular vector formed by two adjacent vectors sharing the given vertex. This is done by calculating the matrix cross product of the two adjacent vectors from v_0 to get the normal vector of that face, and the norm of the cross product to get the area of the face. In each iteration, update the sum of vertex normal by adding the product of the area of the face and the norm. Lastly, update the sum of the vertex normal as a unit vector and multiply by -1 so that the direction of normal is not facing inside the mesh.<br>
Here are screenshots of dae/teapot.dae comparing teapot shading with and without vertex normals. <br>

<img src="/cs184project-webpages/proj2/images/task4/task4-diagram.png" width = "300" height = "350"><br>
The implementation technique of edge flip is based on the "guide to implementing edge operations". We first layout explicit definitions of all the half-edges, vertices, edges, and faces before the flip and this can be done by laying out the half edge of the given edge and traversing to get all half-edges including the outer edges using half-edge operations next() and twin(). Note that the outer edges are defined by the twin of the edges of the inside faces. Also note that assigning the vertices, edges, and faces to a corresponding half-edge pointer is not unique. Next, to flip the edge we have to reassign existing half-edges, vertices, edges, and faces’ pointers to match the new layout as shown in the before and after diagram above.<br>
Here are the screenshots of the teapot before and after some edge flips.<br>

	<figcaption>teapot before some edge flips.</figcaption><br>
	
	
The major issue we have faced was whenever we tried to flip an edge, an edge and an outer face was missing. We have speculated that our implementation was incorrect on the outer edges and it turned out that our explicit definition of the outer half-edges formed a quadrilateral rather than outer_edge = outer_edge->next(). Further, when reassigning the outer half-edges, we have to preserve the face and their pointer to the next half-edge.<br>

We first layout explicit definitions of all the half-edges, vertices, edges, and faces before the split and this can be done by laying out the half edge of the given edge and traversing to get all half-edges including the outer edges using half-edge operations next() and twin(). Note that the outer edges are defined by the twin of the edges of the inside faces. Also note that assigning the vertices, edges, and faces to a corresponding half-edge pointer is not unique. Unlike edge flip, an edge split creates 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, 2 new faces, and 6 new half-edges. Then reassign existing half-edges, vertices, edges, and faces’ pointers to match the new layout as shown in the before and after diagram above and ensure that the faces and next pointer of the half-edges of the outer elements are preserved. <br>

We got the implementation of edge split correct the first time :D

	<h1 style="font-size:150%;">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h1>	
	<h1 style="font-size:100%;">Implementation of the loop subdivision and interesting implementation / debugging tricks we have used</h1>
	<p>
How I implemented loop subdivision: Our loop subdivision algorithm first calculates each of the new positions of newly created vertices as well as old vertices and then does the splitting edges and edge flipping operation to get 4 sub-triangles. The new position stores the position after the loop subdivision transformation. This is done by first calculating the new position of new vertices formed by splitting (midpoint of an old edge), but we don’t actually do the split operation here, and have it depend on the positions of 4 neighboring vertices. Next, the new position of the old vertices are calculated by the number of degrees it has and the sum of the position of neighboring vertices. Then, we do the edge split operation on all the old edges and flip any edges that are new edges and that exactly one of the vertices is new and one is old. Lastly, assign the actual positions of all vertices to the newly transformed positions calculated in the first two steps.
Debugging tricks: Most of our correctness implementations are based on meticulous design and then code implementation. An interesting observation is that bean.dae looked somewhat correct in our initial implementation but looked like there was some overlap. The overlap as well as some help from Ed allowed us to determine that the issue was that of calculating the result of the new position must be correctly evaluated as a floating-point value and not an integer.

	<h1 style="font-size:100%;">Observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision: sharp corners and edges</h1>
Behavior: As the mesh applies subdivision there will obviously be more triangles and the mesh becomes somewhat more "round". <br>
Sharp corners and Edges: For sharp edges, the edges are laid as a basis for the small triangles. For sharp corners, you can see the edges that make up somewhat like a rotated hexagon and for higher iterations of loop subdivision, you can actually see bumps rather than truly spherical ones.<br>
Can this effect be reduced by pre-splitting: I do not think that pre-splitting eliminates the effects of the sharp corners. Even if you try to do some sort of split operation before loop subdivision, the fact remains that the sharp edge is pointy.

	<h1 style="font-size:100%;">Asymmetry on loop subdivision for the cube</h1>
Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. How can we pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? <br>
Explanation of asymmetry is present: When we subdivide the mesh, we expected that the mesh would morph into a cube with rounded corners, but instead, we see that the subdivision results in a curved edge that is short on one side and long on the other side. The reason why there is some asymmetry is the fact that for some vertices it has even degrees (number of neighboring vertices) and some have odd degrees. Since our algorithm calculates the new position of the old vertex based on the position of the neighboring vertices as well as the degrees. Thus, the position of vertices with even degrees are not symmetrical with odd degree vertices. 
How pre-processing reduces the effect of asymmetry: We can achieve symmetry by splitting on the edges that lie on the middle of each face of the cube. Then loop subdivision will create a symmetrical mesh that resembles a rounded-corner cube. This reduces asymmetry because all the vertices have degree-6 and thus the position should be relatively symmetrical.
